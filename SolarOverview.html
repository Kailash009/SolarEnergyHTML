<h3 style="color:white;">In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 42%. Thanks to strong federal policies like the solar Investment Tax Credit, rapidly declining costs, and increasing demand across the private and public sector for clean electricity, there are now more than 97 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity installed nationwide, enough to power nearly 18 million homes.</h3>

BOSTON and WASHINGTON, D.C.— Today Governor Baker signed “An Act Creating A Roadmap for the Next Generation of Climate Policy” into law, ending a months-long standoff with the legislature on this bill.

Under the bill, homeowners and small businesses that install solar won’t see property tax increases and larger solar systems that already have an agreement in place for tax payments will be exempt from additional taxes. In addition, the Commonwealth’s main solar incentive program, known as the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target, will now serve more low- to moderate-income families.</h3>

The cost to install solar has dropped by more than 70% over the last decade, leading the industry to expand into new markets and deploy thousands of systems nationwide. Prices as of Q4 2020 are at their lowest levels in history across all market segments. An average-sized residential system has dropped from a pre-incentive price of $40,000 in 2010 to roughly $20,000 today, while recent utility-scale prices range from $16/MWh - $35/MWh, competitive with all other forms of generation.</h3>
