<h3 style="color:white;">Solar water heating system is a device that uses solar energy to heat water for domestic, commercial, and industrial needs. Heating of water is the most common application of solar energy in the world. A typical solar water heating system can save up to 1500 units of electricity every year, for every 100 litres per day of solar water heating capacity.
A solar water heating system consists of a flat plate solar collector, a storage tank kept at a height behind the collector, and connecting pipes.
The collector usually comprises copper tubes welded to copper sheets (both coated with a highly absorbing black coating) with a toughened glass sheet on top and insulating material at the back. The entire assembly is placed in a flat box.
In certain models, evacuated glass tubes are used instead of copper; a separate cover sheet and insulating box are not required in this case.

<h3 style="color:white;">SWHs can be used at homes for producing hot water that can be used for bathing, cleaning, and washing. Solar water heaters (SWHs) of 100-300 litres capacity are suited for domestic application. Larger systems can also be used for a variety of industrial applications. Hot water at 60-80oC could be obtained through use of solar water heaters.
Fuel Savings: A 100 litres capacity SWH can replace an electric geyser for residential use and saves 1500 units of electricity annually.
Saves cost on power generation - The use of 1000 SWHs of 100 litres capacity each can contribute to a peak load saving of 1 MW.
Environmental benefits - A SWH of 100 litres capacity can prevent emission of 1.5 tonnes of carbon-dioxide per year.
Pay back period - SWHs have a life span of 15-20 years. The pay back period is about 3-4 years when electricity is replaced, 4-5 years when furnace oil is replaced and 6-7 years when coal is replaced.</h3>
<h3 style="color:white;">
There are nearly 12,000 major solar projects currently in the database, representing more than 160 GW of capacity.
The list shows that there are nearly 47 GW of major solar projects currently operating.
There remains an enormous amount of capacity in the pipeline, with more than 115 GW of large-scale solar projects either under construction or under development.</h3>
<h3 style="color:white;"> In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 42%. Thanks to strong federal policies like the solar Investment Tax Credit, rapidly declining costs, and increasing demand across the private and public sector for clean electricity, there are now more than 97 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity installed nationwide, enough to power nearly 18 million homes.
The cost to install solar has dropped by more than 70% over the last decade, leading the industry to expand into new markets and deploy thousands of systems nationwide. Prices as of Q4 2020 are at their lowest levels in history across all market segments. An average-sized residential system has dropped from a pre-incentive price of $40,000 in 2010 to roughly $20,000 today, while recent utility-scale prices range from $16/MWh - $35/MWh, competitive with all other forms of generation.</h3>
