<h3 style="color:white;">SEIA produces factsheets on topics relating to solar policy, markets and technology. Below you will find our full collection of these resources, organized by topic area.In 1978, Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to encourage fuel diversity via alternative energy sources and to introduce competition into the electric sector. As solar prices have fallen over the last decade, PURPA has become an attractive option for solar developers. Analysts predict that PURPA will be the top driver of utility-scale solar installations moving forward.
Download this PURPA 101 factsheet, which provides an overview of the law itself and the implications for solar deployment.</h3>
<h3 style="color:white;">SEIA makes major solar project data available to the public through the map below. SEIA members have exclusive access to the list as a sortable, searchable MS Excel file that is updated monthly. This version contains additional, valuable information that is not included in the map below, such as the owner, electricity purchaser, land type and expected online date.</h3>

There are nearly 12,000 major solar projects currently in the database, representing more than 160 GW of capacity.
The list shows that there are nearly 47 GW of major solar projects currently operating.
There remains an enormous amount of capacity in the pipeline, with more than 115 GW of large-scale solar projects either under construction or under development.</h3>
<h3 style="color:white;"> In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 42%. Thanks to strong federal policies like the solar Investment Tax Credit, rapidly declining costs, and increasing demand across the private and public sector for clean electricity, there are now more than 97 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity installed nationwide, enough to power nearly 18 million homes.
The cost to install solar has dropped by more than 70% over the last decade, leading the industry to expand into new markets and deploy thousands of systems nationwide. Prices as of Q4 2020 are at their lowest levels in history across all market segments. An average-sized residential system has dropped from a pre-incentive price of $40,000 in 2010 to roughly $20,000 today, while recent utility-scale prices range from $16/MWh - $35/MWh, competitive with all other forms of generation.</h3>
